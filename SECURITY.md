## Reporting Security Issues

If you've found a security issue in HDE, you can submit your report to hope-security[@]unicef.org via email.

Please include as much information as possible in your report to better help us understand and resolve the issue:

- Where the security issue exists (ie. HDE Core, API subsystem, etc.)
- The type of issue (ex. SQL injection, cross-site scripting, missing authorization, etc.)
- Full paths or links to the source files where the security issue exists, if possible
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof of concept or exploit code, if available

If you need to encrypt sensitive information sent to us, please use our [PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F72BF087F3A94FE4A305CE449061F6AC06E40F32):
